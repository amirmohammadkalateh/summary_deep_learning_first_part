# summary_deep_learning_first_part
 vanishing gradiant prevention :
 
1-initialize
2-nonsaturating gradient
3-batch normilization
4-gradient clipping



limited data problem :

1_transfer learning
2_unsupervised pretraining
3_find a similar task with lots of data
$_pay attention to pre_trained models



overfitting :
l1 and l2 regularization
dropout
max_,in_normalization
